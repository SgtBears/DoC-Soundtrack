Module for [Dawn of Civilization](https://github.com/dguenms/Dawn-of-Civilization): adds new religion specific soundtracks for the Middle Ages and Renaissance

## Overview

The soundtrack module addresses the Eurocentrism in the default Beyond the Sword background music. 
In particular, the Christian chants during the Medieval era break immersion when playing a civilization with a different religion. 
With the soundtrack module, the music in various eras now depends on the state religion, making use of some tracks included in BtS and some additional ones bundled with the module. 
In addition to the default soundtrack for Christian civilizations there are now soundtracks for the Middle Eastern (Islam/Zoroastrianism), South Asian (Hinduism/Buddhism) and East Asian (Confucianism/Taoism/Buddhism) religious groups. 
For civs without a state religion the Classical Era soundtrack extends into the Middle Ages.

## Installation

You can install the module simply by cloning this repository somewhere and copying its Assets folder into your "RFC Dawn of Civilizaton" directory.
